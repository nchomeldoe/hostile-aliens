# hostile-aliens

This is a game created according to the following biref:

Create a simple text only game with a single button that hits a random alien ship in the fleet.
Each time the button is pressed, a random alien ship is hit and its hit points are reduced.
Once an alien ships points have hit zero the ship is destroyed and can’t be hit again. The
game is over once all alien ships have been destroyed.
Rules
• You should be able to start a new game once the game is over
• Some text visualisation of the ships and their hit points
• The game should have the following Alien ships:
o 1 x Mother ship-
▪ 100 Hit Points -
▪ Loses 9 hit points every time it is hit -
▪ All ships are destroyed if the Mother ship is destroyed
o 5 x Defence ship -
▪ Each one starts with 80 hit points -
▪ Each one Loses 10 hit points each time it is hit
o 8 x Attack ship
